2. Integrity - data validation, transaction logs, tamper detection
3. Availability - Redundant systems, regular maintenance, disaster recovery plans.
#### 2. Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
1. Separation of duties - Separate as needed resources by departments, prevents someone from gaining too much power.
2. Mandatory Vacations - Forces the relegation of the system to someone else, prevents exclusive access for any one user
