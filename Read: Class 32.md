### What is Malware Analysis?

 ####   You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
As a Malware Analyst, my job involves examining and understanding the behavior of malicious software to figure out what it does, how it spreads, and how it can be detected and removed.
   #### What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? What’s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
Preparation: Setting up a safe environment to analyze the malware without risking other systems.
Collection: Gathering malware samples for analysis.
Analysis: Examining the malware's code and behavior to understand its functionality and impact.
Documentation: Recording findings, behaviors, and indicators of compromise.
Mitigation: Developing ways to neutralize or reduce the malware's impact.
Reporting: Sharing the analysis, findings, and mitigation steps with relevant stakeholders.
    #### You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?

When analyzing a new malware sample, I would conduct static analysis first. Static analysis involves examining the malware without executing it, using tools to inspect the malware's code, structure, and properties.
