### What is a reverse proxy?
A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client  requests to those web servers. Unlike a traditional proxy, which protects client identities, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the servers non clients and serves as an intermediary for requests directed at these servers.
#### What are the benefits of a forward proxy?

#### Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?
A forward proxy, positioned between the client and the internet, serves several purposes:

Privacy and Security: Masks the user's IP address, enhancing anonymity.
Content Filtering: Restricts access to certain websites or content, useful in organizational or educational settings.
Caching: Stores local copies of frequently accessed resources, reducing bandwidth usage and improving access speeds.
Access Control: Manages internet access for internal network users, enforcing organizational policies.
Direction of Proxying: Forward proxies serve clients wanting to access various servers on the internet. Reverse proxies protect and manage access to a specific server or group of servers.
Primary Use Case: Forward proxies focus on client anonymity and network control, whereas reverse proxies are geared towards load balancing, security, and performance enhancement for web servers.
Operational Position: Forward proxies are situated close to the client side, while reverse proxies are positioned near the server side.

#### Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?

Enhanced Security: By obscuring the backend server's identity, a reverse proxy can protect against direct attacks.
Improved Load Balancing: Efficiently distributes traffic across servers, ensuring stability and reduced downtime.
Performance Optimization: Caching and compressing content can significantly improve website load times.
SSL Encryption: Centralizes SSL/TLS processing, streamlining certificate management and encryption tasks.
