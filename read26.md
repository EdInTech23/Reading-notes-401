Here's how I'd approach these questions:

1. Explaining your role to a family member:

My new job is kind of like being a detective for computers. I look for bad guys trying to break into computer systems and figure out how to stop them.

2. Why PowerShell is an effective attack vector:**

It's built-in:PowerShell is already installed on most Windows computers, so hackers don't need to sneak in extra software.
  It's powerful: PowerShell can do a lot of things on a computer, giving hackers lots of ways to mess things up.
  Hard to spot: It's easy to hide malicious activities within normal-looking PowerShell commands. 

3. Two things to mitigate PowerShell attacks:**

Limit its use: Only allow people who absolutely need PowerShell to use it, and control what they can do with it.
Monitor carefully:Use software to watch for suspicious PowerShell activity and investigate any unusual behavior.
