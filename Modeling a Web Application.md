## Application Threat Modeling

### A Beginners Guide To The STRIDE Security Threat Model

 ####   Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.

Threat modeling is a structured approach used to identify and prioritize potential threats to a system, as well as to identify and implement the most effective countermeasures to mitigate or reduce risks. To explain threat modeling with non-technical, real-world examples, consider the process of securing a house:

Identify What You're Protecting (Assets): This is akin to recognizing what's valuable in your home, such as jewelry, electronics, or personal documents.
Determine and Prioritize Potential Threats: Just as you would consider the likelihood of different threats to your home, like burglary, natural disasters, or accidental fires, threat modeling evaluates the most probable and damaging threats to an application.
Identify Vulnerabilities: This involves recognizing weak points in your home's security, such as unlocked doors, open windows, or an absence of a security system, similar to identifying vulnerabilities in an application that could be exploited by threats.
Mitigate Threats: Just as you would take steps to secure your home by installing locks, security systems, and fire alarms, in threat modeling, you implement security measures to protect the application against identified threats.

 ####   What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
What are we building? This involves understanding the components, functionalities, and flow of data in the application, similar to knowing the layout and contents of your house.
What can go wrong? Identifying potential threats, much like considering what could harm your home or its occupants.
What are we going to do about it? This refers to deciding on and implementing countermeasures to protect against identified threats, akin to putting locks, alarms, and safety practices in place at home.
Did we do a good job? This involves reviewing and testing the security measures to ensure they are effective, similar to regularly checking and maintaining home security features to ensure they are functional.
 
####   You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
threat modeling is an essential practice in developing secure applications,taking proactive steps to secure a home. It allows teams to identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential threats effectively, ensuring the application's integrity, reliability, and user trust.
