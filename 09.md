What is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework used to secure communications and transactions on the internet. It employs cryptographic techniques to provide secure communications and data management
Name the three main components which make up PKI.
Digital Certificates: These are electronic documents used to prove the ownership of a public key. They include the public key being certified, information about the identity of the key owner, the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents (usually a Certificate Authority), and other metadata.

Certificate Authority (CA): This is a trusted entity that issues and manages digital certificates. The CA verifies the identity of entitiesand then issues a digital certificate that ties public keys with identities.

Registration Authority (RA): Often working in conjunction with a CA, the RA is responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity making the request. In some models, the RA doesn't issue the certificates but just acts as an intermediary between the user and the CA.
How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
Imagine you want to send a secure letter to a friend, but you're worried someone might open it along the way. In the world of the internet, PKI is like a special secure mailing system.
What The primary weakness in PKI architecture is its heavy reliance on the trustworthiness and competence of the Certificate Authorities (CAs). If a CA is compromised, or if it issues a certificate improperly, the entire security model can be underminedis the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
