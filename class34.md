Main Differences between Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity
Objective:

Computer Forensics: The primary objective is to investigate digital devices to uncover digital evidence, understand the sequence of events, and provide legal evidence in court.
Cybersecurity: The focus is on protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, threats, and unauthorized access.
Approach:

Computer Forensics: Reactive in nature. Professionals are called in after an incident has occurred to perform investigations and analysis.
Cybersecurity: Proactive and preventive. Efforts are aimed at preventing incidents before they happen through risk management, threat intelligence, and security measures.
Methodology:

Computer Forensics: Involves collecting digital evidence, preserving its integrity, analyzing the data without altering it, and presenting findings in a comprehensible manner, often in legal contexts.
Cybersecurity: Involves implementing security protocols, encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and conducting regular security audits and assessments.
Six Stages of a Computer Forensics Examination
Preparation: This involves setting up the necessary tools, software, and equipment needed for the forensic examination. It includes preparing a forensic workstation, software tools for data recovery and analysis, and ensuring the forensic examiner is trained and ready.

Preservation: The goal here is to preserve the digital evidence in its original form. This involves creating bit-by-bit copies of storage devices, ensuring that the data is not altered, tampered with, or damaged during the forensic process.

Collection: This stage involves the systematic collection of digital evidence from various sources such as hard drives, USB drives, cloud storage, and electronic devices, ensuring that the collection process is documented and verifiable.

Analysis: During this phase, forensic examiners analyze the collected data to uncover relevant information. This involves using forensic tools to recover deleted files, decrypt encrypted data, and analyze file structures and system logs to reconstruct events.

Presentation: The findings from the analysis are compiled into a comprehensive report that details the evidence found, the significance of the evidence, and the methodology used in the examination. This report must be understandable to individuals without technical expertise, as it may be presented in legal proceedings.

Review: This final stage involves reviewing the case to evaluate the effectiveness of the examination process, identify any areas for improvement, and learn lessons for future investigations. This may involve peer reviews, feedback sessions, and process evaluations.
