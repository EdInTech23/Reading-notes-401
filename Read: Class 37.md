Getting Started with Zed Attack Proxy

 ####   What are the three common stages of the Penetration Testing process and what tasks are performed at each one?
Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target system, including publicly available data, to understand the environment and identify potential vulnerabilities.
Scanning: Using tools to actively engage the target system to discover open ports, running services, and specific vulnerabilities that might be present.
Exploitation: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information from the target system, demonstrating the impact of the vulnerabilities.

####    Explain a “main-in-the-middle proxy” in non-technical terms.
 Imagine someone secretly listening to and potentially altering the conversation between two friends passing notes to each other. The friends think they are communicating directly, but the listener in the middle can see and change the messages before passing them on.
  ####  What are the 2 spiders available for use in ZAP?
Traditional Spider: Crawls through websites by following links to discover new pages and content.
AJAX Spider: Specifically designed to interact with web applications that use AJAX and JavaScript, simulating user interactions to discover content that traditional methods might miss.
####  What situations are they best suited for?
Traditional Spider: Best for simpler, static websites where content is directly linked and doesn't rely heavily on JavaScript for navigation or content rendering.
AJAX Spider: Ideal for modern web applications that heavily rely on JavaScript and AJAX for dynamic content generation and complex user interactions.
