What is a SOC?

### What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?
Monitoring and Analysis: SOCs continuously monitor and analyze the activities on networks, servers, endpoints, databases, applications, websites, and other systems. This involves looking for irregular activities that could indicate a security incident or breach, such as unauthorized access or anomalies in network traffic.

Incident Response and Management: When a potential security threat is detected, SOCs are responsible for responding to the incident. This includes determining the scope and impact of the incident, containing it, eradicating the threat, and recovering from the incident. They also work on documenting the incident and learning from it to improve future responses.

Proactive Threat Hunting and Prevention: SOCs actively search for advanced threats that evade existing security measures. This involves analyzing trends and patterns in data to uncover latent threats. They also develop strategies and implement measures to prevent potential security incidents, including updating and tuning security systems, patches, and other defensive measures.
### Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.
Consolidating Information: It brings together all the security information in one place. This is like having a dashboard that shows you every security camera feed in one view.
Detecting Unusual Patterns: It uses sophisticated algorithms to identify patterns that might indicate a security threat, much like a detective spotting clues that something might be amiss.
Providing Real-Time Alerts: When it spots something suspicious, it alerts the security team immediately, enabling a quick response.
Facilitating Investigations: It stores historical data, which can be used to investigate security incidents after they've been detected.
### How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.
First Level (Tier 1): Similar to the front-line support in IT Help Desks, these are the initial responders in a SOC. They monitor alerts, conduct basic analysis, and respond to simple incidents. Like help desk technicians, they resolve issues that require a standard procedure.

Second Level (Tier 2): This tier involves more experienced analysts who handle complex incidents. They are equivalent to the second-level support in an IT Help Desk that deals with more complex IT issues. They perform deeper analyses and may engage in threat hunting.

Third Level (Tier 3): The experts in this tier are similar to specialists in an IT Help Desk. They handle the most advanced and serious security threats. They are responsible for advanced incident investigation and resolution, similar to how senior IT specialists handle complex and high-level IT problems.

Management Level: In both structures, there's a management level overseeing operations, making strategic decisions, and ensuring the alignment of the team's activities with the organization's goals.
